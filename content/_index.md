# Hi
My name's Jacob. I'm a backend-focused software engineer who values explicitness over magic in code. You'll find me most at home when I'm working with Node or Go.

In my spare time, not having the best musical ear, I have come to appreciate learning lots of music theory as a way
to enable me to write [pretty sounding things on the guitar](https://soundcloud.com/jacob-cons).
