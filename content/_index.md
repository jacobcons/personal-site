# Hi
My name's Jacob. I'm a backend developer who enjoys working mainly in the Node ecosystem building clean APIs.
I like to keep code explicit and simple, avoiding unnecessary magic/abstraction.

In my spare time, not having the best musical ear, I have come to appreciate learning lots of music theory as a way
to enable me to write pretty sounding things on the guitar.
